<h1>Birth of a Bittersweet Titan</h1>
<p>
  For our last month of freedom, we have one of the favorites out of the characters that I've created...<b><i>Tora!</i></b> <br>
  Quick little recap again, Tora's a tigeress who works as a mercenary for a <i>very</i> powerful and influential organization. <br>
  Due to her terrifying strength, agility, skills and brash carefree nature, she's usually the best at what she does and <i>boy, does she love doing it.</i> <br>

  Tora is the rep for this month for the same reason as Jodan. Her canonical birthday takes place at the start of this month and <br>
  with it came a special mini comic themed around just exactly that. When Tora thinks that her friends forgot her birthday, she <br>
  starts drinking heavily, which is bad because she is already an alcoholic. What happens next you might ask? Well, why not check it <br>
