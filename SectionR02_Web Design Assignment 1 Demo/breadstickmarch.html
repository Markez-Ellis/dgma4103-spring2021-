    <h2>I really spent a whole month playing this game with this dumb rabbit as my mascot.</h2>
    <p> So this is Breadstick. She's the end result of me being really bored at 4am and going "hey wouldn't it be funny
    <br>

    <br>
     ...Then I did exactly that. Well-timed too because I started playing the totally-not-obscure fighting game.
    <br> Tatsunoko vs Capcom. I still listen to the game's opening song to this day </p>
