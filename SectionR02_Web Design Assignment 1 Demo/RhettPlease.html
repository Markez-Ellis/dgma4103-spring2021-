<h2>So let's talk about the <i>original</i> Rabbit.</h2>

 <p>Another character of mine! His name's Rhett. He's repping this month since he was <br>
    chosen for a week-long AMA (Ask Me Anything) event on a Discord Server I'm apart of. <br>
    I didn't get as many questions compared to other characters who were chosen for the event <br>
    but I had a lot of fun animating the responses for each question I was given. It was a neat <br>
    challenge that I hope to try again in the future when I'm ready. <br>
    <br>
    Oh yeah! I guess I should explain Rhett's deal too, huh? Rhett's a rabbit who lost his limbs during <br>
    an accident regarding his parents researching a new form of energy. Due to an unexpected variable, <br>
    the lab they were researching in exploded and Rhett lost his mother...along with his arms and legs <br>
    due to him being caught in the debris. His father survived but was broken mentally by the loss of <br>
    his wife. He managed to give Rhett prosthetic limbs but things would never be the same for the family.<br> <br>
    Cute, right!? ...At least he still his friends.
