          <h1>"It looks like you've been met with a terrible fate..."</h1>
      <p>Jodan was a character that was created before Quarantine but since this month was her canonical birthday, <br>
        she ended up getting a lot of attention from me in terms of development. For those who don't know (because why would you, honestly), <br>
      Jodan is a kitsune who was sealed away 1000 years ago for a crime she didn't commit. Having gone mad from the forced isolation, (how topical..) <br>
      she tends to steal the souls of lost travelers who fail her Tests of Heart. If you lack proper manners, you can kiss your soul goodbye. </p>
