  <p>So I started taking commisions for the first time this month and it was mostly just to get the funds <br>
    for this game. I saw everyone else play it since quarantine started and I won't lie, I did feel left out. <br>
    Thankfully, I was able to afford it around June and Maeli Island opened up to the public! It pretty much became a routine <br>
    for me to play this game everyday. I was super hooked on it and I loved nothing more than to talk to friends, devastate entire islands <br>
    by stealing all of their resources until they're nothing but emptied husks, go fishing, that sort of thing. I did kinda fall off of it later <br>
    in the Summer but I think it was fun for the time that I had it.
