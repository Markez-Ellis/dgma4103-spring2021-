    <p style= color:white> The last thing I expected to become really prominent in my life was Half Life...it did so anyway.
    <br>
     One of my favorite Let's Players "WoolieVS" started a LP of a remake for the first game around this time,
    <br>
     not only that but a little series called HLVRAI came out which was basically one long improv machinima with a new take on Half Life 1.
    <br> It ended up becoming a really big deal for me and I'd keep watching Half Life content every day.
    <br> Below me are the thumbnails for the HLVRAI series. <br> They were all created by the artist, <b>Logblaster (Twitter @ is @Logblaster).</b>
